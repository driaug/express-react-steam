## Developer's quickstart ðŸ”¥
1. Claim your API key at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
2. Paste your api key in `backend/index.js` on line 25
3. Install dependencies and start in both directories
    - Navigate to backend with `cd backend`
    - Execute `yarn && yarn start`
    - Navigate to frontend with `cd frontend`
    - Execute `yarn && yarn start`
4. A browser will open at http://localhost:3000
5. You are up and running, happy hacking!
    
## Question time ðŸ”§
- Do I have to keep `backend/` and `frontend/` in the same folder?
    - No, you can move them anywhere you like, just make sure the ports (`2000` for backend, `3000` for frontend) stay the same.
